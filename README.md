tp-tests-open-in-webstorm
=========================

Chrome extension to open JavaScript file from TP3 JS test page in WebStorm.

Implementation is heavily inspired by "Open with external application" extension
by Lorenz Cuno Klopfenstein <lck@klopfenstein.net> (https://bitbucket.org/lck/open-with-external-application).

Parts of the extension (namely the native NPAPI plug-ins that launch the external application) are taken from the
SimpleGet Chromium extension (http://code.google.com/p/simple-get).
